==========

`(+` _number_*`)` => _number_

Description
-----------

**+** takes zero or more numbers (either integers or reals) as arguments, and
returns the summation of all of its arguments, cast to the type of the first
argument.

Each argument is cast to the type of the first argument before being included
in the sum.

Passing zero arguments results in a return value of `0.0`.

Passing any non-number arguments results in a runtime error.
