`(-` _number_*`)` => _number_

Description
-----------

**-** takes zero or more numbers as arguments and, if given one argument,
returns the negation of the argument, or otherwise returns the result of
subtracting each subsequent argument from the first, each cast to the type of
the first argument.

Each argument is cast to the type of the first argument before being included
in the calculation.

Passing zero arguments results in a return value of `0.0`.

Passing any non-number arguments results in a runtime error.
