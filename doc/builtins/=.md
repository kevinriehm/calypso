`(=` _symbol_ _expression`_)` => _expression_

Description
-----------

**=** takes a symbol and an expression as an argument and return the
expression, after assigning it as the value of the symbol.

**=** is a special form. Its symbol argument is never evaluated, but its
expression argument is evaluated normally.

Passing more or fewer than two arguments results in a runtime error.

Passing a non-symbol as the first argument results in a runtime error.
